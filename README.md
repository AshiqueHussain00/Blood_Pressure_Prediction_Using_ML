# Blood Pressure Prediction using Machine learning 

## Objective: 
Blood pressure prediction models aim to forecast an individual's future blood pressure using historical data and machine learning, for early detection, personalized treatment, continuous monitoring, and efficient healthcare resource allocation.

1. Early Detection: Predict hypertension or hypotension to enable timely intervention.
2. Personalized Treatment: Customize treatment plans based on individual predictions.
3. Continuous Monitoring: Provide real-time or periodic blood pressure forecasts.
4. Resource Optimization: Efficiently allocate healthcare resources by identifying high-risk individuals.
5. Trend Analysis: Analyze blood pressure patterns over time.
6. Risk Stratification: Categorize patients into risk groups for prioritizing care.
# Tools & Technology:

## Features

-The proposed neural algorithm can be embedded in wearable portable devices to perform continuous healthcare
monitoring of arterial blood pressure in order to prevent onset of irreversible damage, like cardiovascular diseases and
hypertension. Implemented in a device, this algorithm may prove a powerful tool for diagnosing the aggressive covid- 19
virus at an early stage. Future work will focus on three areas. The first will deal with an intensive testing phase of the
algorithm on larger datasets such as MIMIC II and MIMIC III. The second will test the algorithm on a database
characterized by elderly patients and people with cardiovascular pathologies to demonstrate its validity. The third area
will address the danger related to the fact that blood pressure can change suddenly and become dangerous. Since the
variability of intra-person arterial pressure is particularly problematic, especially in precarious health conditions, work on
detecting this danger is the next challenge.
